        "`Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)` were very popular for `Natural Language Processing (NLP)` (for example, machine learning on sentences to translate between languages). Generally, these models are trained to predict the next \"element\" (we say \"element\" here to be very general for this particular analogy). Consider the following sentence:\n",
        "\n",
        "**It's so hot outside, I want to eat**\n",
        "\n",
        "**based on the words seen so far, the model predicts the next \"element\"** A reasonable next \"element\" would be \"ice cream\", yielding the sentence:\n",
        "\n",
        "**It's so hot outside, I want to eat ice cream**\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's think about the `context` of this sentence. It seems reasonable to say that \"ice cream\" makes sense because it is hot outside. This idea of `context` is important for machine learning models to predict the next \"element\". Unfortunately, imagine now a very long excerpt containing many paragraphs. It turns out that `RNNs` can struggle to \"remember\" long `contexts`. More recently, [`Transformers`](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf) (`ChatGPT` is a transformer model!) have demonstrated exceptional ability to handle this problem and has now mostly replaced `RNNs` in `NLP`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ok, but now let's relate what we just discussed to `Molecular Generative Models`. It turns out that most molecules represented as `SMILES` strings are not really that long and `RNNs` can perfectly learn to predict these relatively short `SMILES` sequences (compared to the example of an excerpt with many paragraphs). Correspondingly, `RNN`-based `Molecular Generative Models` have shown remarkable performance in learning the `SMILES` syntax. Below is an example of a molecule and its `SMILES`: \"NC1=CC(O)=CC=C1\" (not very long!)\n",

        "\n",
        "We also said that `Molecular Generative Models` learn to reproduce the properties of the molecules it is trained on. `ZINC` actually contains a lot of `\"drug-like\"` molecules, empirically (loosely) following [`Lipinski's Rule of 5`](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X96004231). `\"drug-likeness\"` can be quantified by the [`Quantitative Estimate of Drug-likeness (QED) score`](https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1243). Your next task is to verify that the `QED` distribution of the `ZINC` training data is reproduced by the pre-trained model."

We refer the reader to this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30839-x) - check out the figures showing overlap!

        "The answer is that `Molecular Generative Models` are kind of like a mime. You can generate new molecules that fit into the properties distribution in your training data. When could this be useful? Imagine you have a dataset of molecules with properties in the range that you are interested in. The out-of-the-box `Molecular Generative Models` can give you new molecules within this properties range! **What if you want to generate molecules outside the training data properties distribution?** Turns out what we presented here is the foundation for coupling optimization algorithms which can ***shift*** the probability distribution of the `Molecular Generative Model` to the property ranges you want. Next week, you will see this first-hand with a practical tutorial on `REINVENT`.\n",

Imagine you have a stack of pancakes, some with blueberries and some with raspberries. You then take the biggest spatula you can find and squash it such that you can't even distinguish the pancakes from each other anymore - they are all combined together into a giant pancake like in the image. Now imagine the surface of this giant flat pancake. You start looking around and you notice some blueberries and think to yourself, \"this must have came from the blueberry pancake originally\". You look around some more and you see another piece of pancake but with both blueberries and raspberries. There were no original pancakes with both berries so you conclude that this piece of pancake must have been from a little bit of the blueberry pancake and a little bit of the raspberry pancake.\n",

        "The `Encoder` takes molecules and converts it into a low-dimensional vector and maps it onto a `Gaussian Distribution`. Recall that `Gaussian Distributions` are completely defined by their `mean` and `variance`. Specifically, knowing both the `mean` and `variance` allows you to construct the full `Gaussian Distribution`. The `Latent Vector` is now computed based on the `mean` and `variance` but with some noise added to it. In the image, this noise is drawn from a `Gaussian Distribution`. The job of the `Decoder` is to take this `Latent Vector` and `reconstruct` the input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's tie this back to the pancakes analogy. By converting all molecules into a low-dimensional vector via the `Encoder`, a continuous `Latent Space` is created. We squash all our blueberry and raspberry pancakes into a single giant pancake (we take all our molecules and \"flatten\" them). The model can be trained to `reconstruct` the blueberry pancake (some molecule) given the squashed blueberry pancake (the `Latent Vector`). What happens when you get to the pancake piece that has both blueberries and raspberries? By defining a continuous `Latent Space`, the `reconstructed` molecule from this chunk of pancake is a hybrid between blueberry and raspberry. This is where the `Generative Molecular Model` comes in: by sampling `Latent Vectors` from the `Latent Space`, the `Decoder` can `reconstruct` different molecules back!\n",

They also show how you can move in the `Latent Space` to go from some starting molecule to another molecules with desired properties. Here, we omit further details and instead try to visually demonstrate what the `Latent Space` is."
